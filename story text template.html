<p> Pico walks out of his home and looks up at the sky just long enough to see the sun for one last time. He's finally turned 40, and that means he's an adult now. So, he's going to do what all adult dwarfs do. Dig.

</p>

<p> He pulls out his trusty shovel and starts parting the earth. Before long he descends through the soil, leaving the warm sun behind. The only light comes from his head-lamp and the only noise from his labored breathing. But like all dwarves he is a tireless creature.

</p>

<p>
    After some time, and many, many meters of digging he falls into an empty cavern, but instead of hitting the soft earth he falls onto a slab of solid steal. His robust body is completely unharmed, but he's completely perplexed by a massive metal door and a computer screen.
</p>

<p> The computer screen has a huge list of numbers and some instructions. He can't make sense of it, but maybe you can.</p>
