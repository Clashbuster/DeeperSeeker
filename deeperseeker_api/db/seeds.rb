    He pulls out his trusty shovel and starts parting the earth. Before long, his entire body descends leaving the sun behind. The only light comes from his head-lamp and the only noise from his labored breathing. Don't worry, dwarves are tireless creatures.
       
    After some time, and many, many meters of digging he falls into an empty cavern, but instead of hitting the soft earth he falls onto a slab of solid steel. He is unharmed, but met by a massive metal door and a computer screen.

    Pico doesn't know what all of this dad-gum technology is. He's never seen a metal door, much less a computer screen. It's basically magic to him.

A second door opened to reveal a colossal launch chamber with a huge ship in the center and a closed silo at the top. Pico stood in the middle of a massive man-made complex with many half-working lights, delapidated machines, and thin catwalks. The place was overgrown with plants, and some of the rooms had been caved in. There are weird red flags posted everywhere with an ominous black symbol depicting some hideous sillouhette that looked like an octopus of some kind.

    All Pico coulkd thing about was that the colossal chamber extended downward further than the eye could see, which delighted him because that meant he could keep going deeper while saving some energy.

    Pico took one step towards a nearby catwalk when a bored voice came over a nearby intercom.

    Can you give me doubles?

    I'll get angry if you don't give me more doubles.\"

    A man wearing a lab coat stood in a room. He doesn't seem to notice Pico or much of anything else. Pico waited for a long time, but the man simply repeated what he said, did a 90 degree turn and held up two fingers to the wall.

    This place is very scary and big, too big for a dwarf. The people are unfriendly and the environment is harsh.\"

    After a bit of this damnable talk he slid up against a wall and sat with his head hung low.

    The longer this goes on the worse our chances of success are. Pico's bad mood will make every he does worse.

It's gnarly branches and roots bent every which way as if in a desperate search in any random direction for more light. It made for a hideous sight.

    Pico had no idea such great things could thrive down here. Even thought it was clear that the tree was being effected by The Great Deep's presence, it's important to note that it could withstand the pressure for so long.

    Eventually, he landed on a page with some english text. Since Pico is hopelessly curious he read it.

    \" My name is Herald, and I used to be scientist. That's right. Used to be. Now I'm a ground prophet. Ground prophets are the greatest, and like all ground prophets I know lots of things about The Great Deep.

    For Example, his Deepness seems to like things that are clean. That's why we clean our labs so much. Spend all day cleaning And with the clean comes the visions. Not everybody takes the visions well, but I can handle them just fine. That must mean I'm chosen or something. I've decided that the best thing I can do is try to interpret them. I have thoughts about what clean means.

    I've decided that even numbers are pretty clean, and we need more even numbers isn't that right Jerry?\"

    Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:
