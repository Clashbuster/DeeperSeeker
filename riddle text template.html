<p> Welcome to the beginning of Pico's quest. He's a dwarf, and dwarfs love to dig. Pico in particular has wanted to dig for his entire life.
    He's going to start digging, and he's going to find some crazy stuff on the way too. The underworld is full of dark secrets and even darker questions.
</p>

<p>Your role in all of this is to help Pico as much as you can, because he's going to face challenges that he won't understand.
    He won't make it without you. His success and his very life depends on your abiltiies.
    He's a simple dwarf who has the mental capacity only to dig, but we won't let him lose if we have anything to say about it!
